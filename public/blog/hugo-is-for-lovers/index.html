	            <p><p>Over the last couple of years, there have been many court cases between US law enforcement and privatecompanies. These cases are often over issues of privacy where government agencies want access to someone&rsquo;s messages or phones. In most of these cases, the communication company wins.</p>

<p>Specifically, in 2016, Apple and the FBI went to court over the FBI&rsquo;s demand that Apple creates a software giving the FBI access to phones. This followed the San Bernardino attack, where the FBI wanted Apple to unlock the phone of someone related to the attack.</p>

<p>Many of the current fears of Americans are grounded in the government issues and what boundaries they should follow. Following these issues, other fears include terrorists attack. Despite, fears of terrorists attacks, Americans still side with Apple even though it may prevent further attacks.It is not guaranteed that the government will use any possible access discreetly.However, do we even think about it?</p>

<p>I must say I agree with Apple&rsquo;s statement that its encryption code secures us the customers from cyberattacks. However, how many of us actually thought this far when we first heard this issue. So many persons simply did not want the government to have access to their phone. Why then, do we not want the government to access this information compared to Apple?</p>

<p>In the US constitution there are many laws that demand protection from the state. Historically Americans have been very concerned with what they believe to be an overarching government. The British government imposed tax on American colonists and they in turn resisted. Here, the roots of the fear of &ldquo;big government&rdquo; began. As a result, the American dream has come to encompass the ability of any one to pursue wealth and happiness outside of the government. Is it possible that this fear still exists today?</p>

<p>Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm can identify people without seeing their face based on other factors such as what type of clothes do they normally wear. It has a 86% accuracy.
Is it that Apple represents the American dream? I spoke to a history professor last week and asked him this question: Is our current preference of corporations versus the government rooted in our revolutionary days? He believes it may be somewhat rooted in it. In America, we treasure, and rightly so, the fact that any &ldquo;ole person&rdquo; can become successful in life based on their own. We are suspicious of the government that holds too much power and may impose restrictions on the people that inhibit that dream. Does Apple represent the average American that can one day create a multinational company and champion the cause of the common man? If so, how &ldquo;average&rdquo; is Apple and its leaders?</p>

<p>In 2014, Apple&rsquo;s market cap ranked 20th when compared to countries GDP. In other words, Apple made more money than all but 19 countries.  With its leadership and funds, it could loosely be compared to a government. The big difference? We did not elect its leadership. In two or four years, we cannot vote them out of power. Yet, we are more willing to entrust most of our personal details with them. We believe that they use all this power and information positively and discreetly, at least more than the government.</p>

<p>I am not saying we should mistrust corporations and give the government access to everything. The next time we agree to privacy, terms and agreements let us read it in details as much as we would a government entity. How about questioning their motives as much as we do the government? Similarly, as Apple and other representatives of the American dream help us keep our government in check, how about we also monitor their decisions.</p>
