      <description>Hi there My name is Radek and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.
We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.
This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!</description>

      <description> &amp;ldquo;Hello, friend?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s lame. Maybe I should give you a name&amp;hellip;
But that&amp;rsquo;s a slippery slope.
You&amp;rsquo;re only in my head.
We have to remember that&amp;hellip;
Shit.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually happened.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking to an imaginary person.

      <description>Villain or CriminalI recently re-watched Now You See Me both 1 and 2. In watching them I could not help but draw parallel references to the Robin Hood nature of the protagonists. So for those who do not what Now You See Me is about I will give you a summary.
Now You See Me is a crime film about a guy’s 30 year retribution plan against the people who helped kill his father.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of years, there have been many court cases between US law enforcement and private companies. These cases are often over issues of privacy where government agencies want access to someone’s messages or phones. In most of these cases, the communication company wins. Specifically, in 2016, Apple and the FBI went to court over the FBI’s demand that Apple creates a software giving the FBI access to phones.</description>
