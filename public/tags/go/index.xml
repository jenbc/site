      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Villain or Criminal I recently re-watched Now You See Me both 1 and 2. In watching them I could not help but draw parallel references to the Robin Hood nature of the protagonists. So for those who do not what Now You See Me is about I will give you a summary.
Redistribution of Power Now You See Me is a crime film about a guy&amp;rsquo;s 30 year retribution plan against the people who helped kill his father.</description>
